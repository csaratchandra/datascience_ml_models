# Regression_models

    Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. Models are mainly used for prediction. Focus is on a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors' - X). 

    Below are the details on implementation of various regression models and where to use them:

    1) Linear Regression
        - # of independent variables (X): One or more
        
        - Shape of regression line: TBD

        - Type of dependent variable (Y): Not Applicable?

    2) Logistic Regression
        - # of independent variables (X): One or more
        
        - Shape of regression line: TBD

        - Type of dependent variable (Y): Binary - True or False/lived or died/Yes or not/0 or 1
